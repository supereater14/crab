Otherwise, if the PWD environment variable contains a pathname of the current directory that is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes including the terminating null, and the pathname does not contain any components that are dot or dot-dot, it is unspecified whether pwd writes this pathname to standard output or behaves as if the −P option had been specified.
